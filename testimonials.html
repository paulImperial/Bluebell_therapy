    <h3 class="quirky">Hypnotherapy</h3>
    
    <p id="needle"><strong>Needle phobia</strong> For as long as i can remember I have had a phobia of needles. This became more of a problem as I got older
    and my reactions to needles became embarrassing. I didn't think that anything or anyone would be able to help me overcome this fear. To my astonishment and relief,
    after just one session with Judith, i was able to have my blood taken and felt calm and in control. I can't thank you enough Judith. <strong>Stacey</strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>Stress and anxiety</strong> Thank you Judith - since our hypnotherapy sessions, i now have some great strategies to deal with stress and feel
     much calmer and able to cope with life. <strong>Susan</strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>Nail biting</strong> After around 26 years of having a very stubborn and damaging nail biting habit, i was sceptical that hypnotherapy would work at all. I couldn't have been more wrong!.
    After a few sessions with Judith, I'm no longer conscious of hiding my nails in public. A massive thanks to you Judith. <strong>James</strong></p>
    
    <h3 class="quirky">Counselling</h3>
    
    <p name="david">Thank you for helping me to understand my issues and guiding me through them. <strong>David</strong></p>
    
    <p>I felt completely comfortable and relaxed with Judith talking through my difficulties. Opening up and exploring my feelings has really helped me
     to make positive changes in my life. <strong>Helen</strong></p>
