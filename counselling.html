        I offer integrative counselling. This means that I can draw on different theoretical approaches and models to find one that
        really suits you and your personal needs. I believe that this flexibility is really important when treating different
        individuals.

        <h2 class="quirky">How does counselling help?</h2>
        <p>
            It is often difficult to 'see the wood for the trees' when we experience challenges in our lives. Talking issues through with a trained counsellor often helps the client to begin to see things
            more clearly and empowers them to start to take control of their situation. During each counselling session, clients can talk freely and without judgment in a way that is often difficult with family or friends.
            Everything is confidential and there is a respect and acceptance between client and counsellor. Clients are not directed towards particular outcomes; instead they are helped to be able to make the right decisions for themselves.
            This may involve talking through various options in a supportive environment.
        </p>
