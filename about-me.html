    <p>I am a qualified hypnotherapist and psychotherapeutic counsellor having obtained a Distinction in my Diploma in Hypnotherapy and Counselling, as well as a Professional Diploma in Integrative Counselling.</p>  <p>I am a professional accredited member of both the National Hypnotherapy Society and The National Counselling Society, bodies whose primary purpose is the advancement of knowledge and the fostering of professional expertise and development. As such, I am bound by their professional Code of Ethics. My hypnotherapy qualification is also accredited by the Royal College of Nursing.</p>
    <p>Other qualifications include a BSc(Hons), an M.A, a PGCE and 18 years experience as a teacher, working with children and young people. Although the two roles are very different in some ways, the skill sets are similar: the desire to help people, the need to provide empathy and the ability to support and encourage. I have an enhanced up to date DBS (previously CRB) check, which is updated annually for the protection and reasurrance of clients.</p> 
    <p>I engage in continuing professional development and am currently studying for an Advanced Counselling qualification.  I have also had some extra training in the following: Stress and anxiety, depression in young people, eating disorders and self-harming behaviour.
    <strong><p>Counselling and Hypnotherapy are great tools for achieving personal goals.</p>  <p>I can provide the skills and the nurturing environment in which you can change your life for the better.</p>
    <p>I currently work part-time as a therapist from the Tranquility Holistic Therapy Centre and Studio in Chilwell and The Park Hypnotherapy Centre in Canning Circus, just outside Nottingham city centre.</p></strong>
